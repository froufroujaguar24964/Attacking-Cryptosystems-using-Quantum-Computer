We used Shor's algorithm and Simon's algorithm to Break RSA and Even mansour respectively. The code for the same can be found in RSA_EM.ipynb file.

We used code at https://github.com/froufroujaguar24964/Attacking-Cryptosystems-using-Quantum-Computer.git <br>
to generate even_mansour_attack.png. Which is the starting point to break Even Mansour Cipher. 

You can also find our report and presentation with same names.

This repo is part of CS6570 project.
